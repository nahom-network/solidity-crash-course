## Introduction

## Mappings

Mappings are an important data type in Solidity. With a mapping we can take values of one data type and map them to values of another data type.

Let's consider an example. Say you wanted to track balances of a bunch of addresses:

|                  address                   | balance |
| :----------------------------------------: | :-----: |
| 0xc783df8a850f42e7F7e57013759C285caa701eB6 |   500   |
| 0xeAD9C93b79Ae7C1591b1FB5323BD777E86e150d4 |   100   |
| 0xE5904695748fe4A84b40b3fc79De2277660BD1D3 |   20    |

Based on what we have learned so far you might be thinking of creating an array of structs:

```solidity
struct Account {
    address addr;
    uint balance;
}

Account[] accounts;
```

<emoji id="point_up" /> This works, certainly. When we need to find an address balance we can iterate through the accounts to find the address we're looking for and retrieve the balance.

**However**, there's a better way! We can use a mapping:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint) balances;
```

<emoji id="point_up" /> With a mapping each address is mapped to a unique place in memory where it stores the `uint` balance. Looking up the balance is as simple as providing the address to the mapping: `balances[addr]`.

> <emoji id="bulb" /> Under the hood, the storage location is found by hashing the `balances` variable location with the address passed in. It's a simple lookup! Much more efficient than iteration. Generally it's better to try to use a mapping **first** and only use an array when you realize you need to iterate.

Now that we see how mappings fit into the picture, let's learn how to build them! <emoji id="world_map" />
